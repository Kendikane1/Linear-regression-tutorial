## About this project
In this project we work with a dataset [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iyadavvaibhav/ecommerce-customer-device-usage). We suppose that a company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. We are here to help them make a data-driven decision. Note that all of the data is not real.

## Note and Credit
This project is for my own education purpose, in order to learn the gist of what Data Science is about from things like importing libraries, importing and understanding data, conducting EDA and building a model that predicts what the goal of this project is set for. I did this project alongside a guide on youtube from [Alejandro](https://www.youtube.com/@alejandro_ao) to help me understand the to flow and process when doing Data Science projects.
